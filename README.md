I've included a `.hex` file you can flash to your board. It is Vial compatible and it's what I'm using. There is also a `.vil` file which is my keymap. You can load it using the Vial app.

I've also included everything I have for this board from my local qmk but there is no guarantee it's going to work. I got it to the point where I could edit my keymap with the Vial app and stopped there as that's all I really need.
